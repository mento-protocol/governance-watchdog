      "description": "{\"title\":\"MGP-0: Fund MiniPay airdrops & incentive campaigns\",\"description\":\"### Summary\\n\\nThis very first Mento Governance Proposal (MGP) aims to give an allowance of up to 10 million MENTO tokens from the [Community Treasury](https://celoscan.io/address/0x890DB8A597940165901372Dd7DB61C9f246e2147) to the [Mento Protocol Foundation](https://celoscan.io/address/0x3468D23A0B1aB3Ab9A537813166A8f7ff1947014) to fund [MiniPay](https://www.opera.com/products/minipay \\\"MiniPay\\\") airdrops and incentive campaigns.\\n\\nThese funds will be used exclusively for MiniPay airdrops and incentive campaigns, which aim to attract new users and reward active ecosystem participants.\\n\\n### Motivation\\n\\nOpera MiniPay is a dollar stablecoin wallet with a \\\"drag and drop\\\" Pockets feature [powered by the Mento Protocol](https://press.opera.com/2024/07/03/mini-pay-unveils-pockets/). It enables users to swap between stablecoin pockets in their MiniPay wallet seamlessly. MiniPay has shown promising potential as a user-friendly and efficient savings and payment solution with over 3M users in Africa. To capitalize on this momentum and accelerate growth, we believe it is important to continue running strategic airdrops and incentive campaigns. These initiatives will help:\\n\\n* Increase awareness and adoption of MiniPay (and thereby increase usage and adoption of the Mento Protocol)\\n* Reward early adopters and active users\\n* Stimulate ecosystem activity and token circulation\\n* Attract new developers and partners to build on MiniPay and Mento\\n\\n### Specification\\n\\nThis proposal outlines the following actions:\\n\\n1. The [Community Treasury](https://celoscan.io/address/0x890DB8A597940165901372Dd7DB61C9f246e2147) approves up to 10 million of its MENTO tokens to be spent by the [Mento Protocol Foundation](https://celoscan.io/address/0x3468D23A0B1aB3Ab9A537813166A8f7ff1947014) to fund MiniPay airdrops and incentive campaigns.\\n   * Roughly 2m out of these 10m tokens are earmarked retroactively for the inaugural MiniPay campaign that ended on October 1, 2024\\n2. Require the Mento Protocol Foundation to provide quarterly reports in this governance forum on the usage of funds and the impact of the campaigns, with the first report being due by January 15, 2025 (and then every subsequent 3 months until the 10m MENTO tokens have either been used up or the approval has been revoked)\\n   * Reports can be simple forum post updates detailing the use of funds and the performance of airdrops & incentivization campaigns (i.e. impact on daily active users, stable tokens in circulation, transaction volume)\\n\\n### Rationale\\n\\nWe allocate the tokens to the Mento Protocol Foundation (instead of a wallet under MiniPay's control) to ensure that the Mento DAO still retains some degree of control and that new MiniPay airdrops and incentive campaigns are well-designed and make sense. This approach allows for more agile decision-making by the Mento Protocol Foundation while still maintaining transparency through regular reporting.\\n\\n### Risks and Mitigations\\n\\n* Misuse of approved funds: Mitigated by requiring quarterly reports and limiting the use to specific purposes\\n* Market impact: The Mento Protocol Foundation is advised to distribute tokens gradually to minimize market disruption\\n* Regulatory concerns: The Mento Protocol Foundation will ensure compliance with relevant regulations in all jurisdictions where campaigns are conducted\\n\\n### Timeline\\n\\nIf approved, the Mento Protocol Foundation can fund MiniPay airdrops and incentive campaigns with up to 10m MENTO. The first quarterly report is due by the end of Q4 on January 15, 2025 (allowing 15 days after the quarter ends to account for the end-of-year holidays).\\n\\nSubsequent reports would then be due on the following schedule:\\n\\n* April 15, 2025 - Q1 '25 Report\\n* July 15, 2025 - Q2 '25 Report\\n* October 15, 2024 - Q3 '25 Report\\n* January 15, 2026 - Q4 '25 Report\\n* etc\"}",
